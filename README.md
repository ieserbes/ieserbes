# Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Isil, a passionate bioinformatician on a journey of continuous learning and exploration. 
Currently pursuing my second Master's degree in Bioinformatics, I am deeply fascinated by the intersection of molecular genetics, data science, and machine learning.

Feel free to explore my repositories, ask questions, or collaborate on exciting projects.
